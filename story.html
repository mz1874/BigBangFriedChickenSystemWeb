    <h2>SERVING REALLY GOOD CHICKEN TO THOSE WHO ENJOY REALLY GOOD CHICKEN.</h2>
    <p>At BIG BANG FRIED CHICKEN, we deliver authentic traditions, bold tastes and straightforward, consistent food you
      can trust.</p>
    <p>After all, we're more than fried chicken. We're the rugged territory forged by sun and terrain.</p>
    <p>The crisp, satisfying bite of a meal earned through hard work. The feeling of community that comes through shared
      moments and simple pleasures.</p>
    <h2>THE TASTE OF BBFC</h2>
    <p>We're the taste of BBFC and we can't be mimicked. We're real but not boring. Simple but not basic. Familiar but
      always surprising.</p>
    <p>That's why no matter the day, no matter who you're with, you're eager to c'mon over, give your chicken a spicy
      jalape√±o squeeze, and share some hearty sides.</p>
    <p>It's why our taste always delivers, time and again.</p>
    <p>Why our food means more than hand-crafted chicken meals that harken back to simpler times.</p>
    <p>It means wide-open spaces, brought to you by people who value tradition and value what's real, fresh and full of
      flavor.</p>
